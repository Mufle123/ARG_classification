This work is my final thesis for an undergraduate degree in computer science at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing. I have applied the knowledge and skills acquired during my studies to the development of this thesis.
# Summary

Antibiotic resistance is a current problem in medicine. One of the ways to identify and
classify resistance is through artificial intelligence technologies such as language models
and machine learning.
In this study, I utilized a publicly available dataset of resistance gene sequences from the
CARD database and used a protein language model to create numerical representations of
these genes. I trained two XGBoost machine learning models. One model was trained to
identify, and the other to classify genes that confer resistance.
The trained model can identify with 97 % accuracy whether a gene causes resistance, and
if the gene causes resistance, the model can determine with 97 % accuracy to which
antibiotic the gene is resistant. Such a model could find a place in practice as an aid in
selecting treatment.
